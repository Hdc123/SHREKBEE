Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt,
Somebody gotta wanna hold his hand so God made girls
Somebody's gotta make 'em get dressed up,
Somebody's gotta give 'em a reason to wash that truck,
Somebody gotta teach 'em how to dance so God made girls
He needed something soft and loud and sweet and proud
But tough enough to break a heart
Something beautiful and breakable that lights up in the dark
So God made girls God made girls he stood back and told the boys
I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls (For singing in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to their own beat)
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls.
Somebody's gotta be the one to cry
Somebody's gotta let him drive, give him a reason
To hold that door so God made girls
Somebody's gotta put a fight,
Make him wait on a Saturday night,
To walk downstairs and blow his mind,
So God made girls
Someone that can wake him up and call his bluff
And drag his butt to church, someone that is hard to handle
Somethin' fragile to hold him when he hurts
So God made girls God made girls
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls (For singin' in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to their own beat)
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls
Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt,
Somebody gotta wanna hold his hand so God made girls
God made girls
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls. (For singin' in your front seat)
God made girls (For dancin' to their own beat)
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls
Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt,
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt,
Somebody gotta wanna hold his hand so God made girls
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads
It started in fun, I needed someone
And now the hurt has begun
I was lonely and it all started in fun
She had left me and I needed just anyone
So it happened to be you
Someone I can tell my troubles to
And now we've gone too far, the hurt has begun
And I can't trust me in your arms anymore
It's not just another thrill like before
Every time your lips touch mine
We get closer all the time
And I can't trust me in your arms anymore
It started in fun, I needed someone
And now the hurt has begun
And I can't trust me in your arms anymore
It's not just another thrill like before
Every time your lips touch mine
We get closer all the time
And I can't trust me in your arms anymore
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia, but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (Yeah)
God's country
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
